            <h3>2 September 2025: Private Status and Opting Out</h3>

            <p class="news_text">
                Members have always had the option of making their accounts private, which means t8hey will not appear
                in
                any public ranked tables, including the fastest solver tables. However, we have now provided an option
                which allows members to maintain public status, but opt out of individual fastest solver tables. If you
                have earned a place in any table, by viewing that table you will see a link at the end of the row
                containing your username which allows you to opt out of that particular table. Please be aware that
                opting out is permanent, so you will be asked to confirm your choice before it is completed. <br><br>

                To ensure consistency in relation to privacy options, and to simplify the whole process, a change has
                been made to how accounts with private status are now handled. This change only impacts the fastest
                solvers tables. If the account is private, any problems solved during this time will automatically be
                opted out to reduce the burden of performing this task manually each time. <br><br>

                However, an important change to be aware of is that the choice of switching accounts from public to
                private now will automatically opt you out of all previously solved problems. <br><br>

                Please note that if your account is currently private, no changes have been made to your previous
                problems at this stage. However, if you would like to take advantage of this more robust privacy option,
                you can switch to public and back to private again. <br><br>

                These changes are made clear on your Account page in the section where you can make your account
                private, where it explains the consequence of switching between public and private. In addition, the
                privacy policy has been updated to reflect these changes. <br><br>

                We hope that the flexibility of the new opt out feature and the simplification of what it means to have
                a private account is clearer and more helpful for everyone.

            <h3>13 August 2025: MathJax Changes</h3>

            <p class="news_text">
                The guide to formatting posts has always asked members to use single dollar for inline TeX content and
                double dollar for block level, but some alternatives were previously supported. For example, it was
                possible to use \[ and \] delimiters for block level and you were able to add TeX to the page directly
                by using \begin{...} \end{...}. However, this put a burden on the JavaScript module that processes the
                MathJax because it had to scan the entire page to render content. Consequently, support for the
                alternative delimiters has been removed. <br><br>

                Due to the way that the new BBCode module parses posts, TeX content is now served directly to the
                MathJax module, so this should make pages load quicker and put less burden on client browsers. In
                addition, restricting the delimiters to single dollar and double dollar enables the posts to be more
                stable as content is strictly processed as TeX. <br><br>

                Rather than just turn off the alternatives and leave posts broken, I have done my best to convert
                existing posts to handle the new required format with some degree of automation. But please be aware
                that I had to manually oversee more than one-thousand posts over several days, so there may be some of
                those posts that are not displaying as expected any longer. I would ask members who used the alternative
                methods to be vigilant and if you get the chance, please check over your own posts to ensure they are
                viewing correctly. <br><br>

                I realise this might be frustrating for those who have been using the alternative methods, but I hope
                that you appreciate the attempt to make the forum more robust and easier to use for everyone. <br><br>

            <h3>5 August 2025: BBCode Update 2025</h3>

            <p class="news_text">
                Over the years the BBCode module used in the problem threads has continued to be modified and have
                additional tags added. So, to ensure a more streamlined performance, the entire module has been
                rewritten. Every attempt has been made to support both recent and legacy posts and I have tried my best
                to check the rendering is accurate on multiple posts. But it is quite possible that I might have missed
                something. If you have identified an issue, please report it at the designated thread on the alternative
                forum: BBCode Update 2025 <br><br>

                I have added a few new tags and tidied up the way some of the existing tags are used. Check out About...
                Forum Tags for more information. <br><br>

                In addition, these changes have had a knock-on effect with how the syntax highlighter operates. So if
                you spot something not quite right, please report it at the thread above. As a small bonus, it is now
                possible to switch the syntax highlighting stylesheet from your Account page. The default, and the one
                we have been using for many years, is Stack Overflow, but you can also use GitHub and Google, which all
                support light (default) and dark mode. <br><br>

            <h3>6 February 2025: Award Updates</h3>

            <p class="news_text">
                New awards have been added along with a number of visual tweaks to sections of the Progress pages to
                support them. Some of them should be obvious, but others might appear a little mysterious.
                <br><br>

            <ul style="margin-left: vh;">
                <li>
                    <b>Three Strikes!</b>:Get the diagonals in any three grids.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Perfect Game</b>: Get the diagonals in all possible grids.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Speed Demon</b>: Solve any fifty problems in under ten minutes each.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Tag Explorer</b>: Solve at least one problem for one-hundred different tags.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Mount Euler</b>: Mastering the mountain of difficulty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Centenarian</b>: Solved a problem on one-hundred different days.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Two existing awards have changed slightly: CC for Continued Commitment has changed from solving the
            first two-hundred problems to complete any two grids and similarly, D for Dedication has changed from
            solving the first five-hundred problems to complete any five grids. <br><br>

            We hope you enjoy the changes.
