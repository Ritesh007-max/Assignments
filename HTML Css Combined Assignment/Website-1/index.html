                    <h3>What is Project Euler?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will
                        require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive
                        at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required
                        to solve most problems.

                        The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for
                        the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and
                        recreational context.

                <h3>Who are the problems aimed at?</h3>

                <p>
                    The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to
                    learn, adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things
                    mathematical, and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the
                    cutting edge.

                    Currently we have 1362225 registered members who have solved at least one problem, representing 220
                    locations throughout the world, and collectively using 113 different programming languages to solve
                    the problems.

                <h3>Can anyone solve the problems?</h3>

                <p>
                    The problems range in difficulty and for many the experience is inductive chain learning. That is,
                    by solving one problem it will expose you to a new concept that may allow you to undertake a
                    previously inaccessible problem. So determined participants will be able to slowly but surely work
                    their way through the problems.
